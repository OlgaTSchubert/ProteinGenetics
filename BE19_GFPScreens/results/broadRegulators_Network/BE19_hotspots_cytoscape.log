5. Go again to Apps -> STRING -> Settings and uncheck the remaining check mark
6. In the Network tab, click on the STRING button and select STRING protein query
7. Copy paste the 29 hotspot gene names (systematic names) into the field to the right of the STRING button.
8. Click the search glass button
9. Go to Apps -> STRING Enrichment -> Retrieve functional enrichment
	Unselect "Retrieve for selected nodes only"
	Background: genome
10. In the lower right, click the STRING Enrichment tab
11. Click on the filter button, select "GO Process" and check "Remove redundant terms"
12. Click into the chart color column and remove color for all except the desired GO categories.

13. Go to File > Import > Styles from file... and select BE19_hotspots_style.xml
   Now, select this style in Style tab where it is called "BE19 Hotspots"
14. Adjust further if necessary:
	To change the default color of all nodes except the highlighted ones, go to the Style -> Node -> Fill Color > RGB: D8D8D8 
    Remove the mapping and bypasses if present.
	To change the border paint and size, set RGB to 4F4F4F and width to 1.0
	To change the node size, check "Lock node width and height" and set size to 50
15. To remove the background color, go to Style -> Network -> Background Paint: under HSV tab, move transparency slider to 100
16. To change the layout, go to Layout -> yFiles Organic Layout
17. Manually adjust nodes to get a nice look
18. To align selected nodes, go to Layout Tools in the lower left corner, select nodes to be aligned and click the appropriate buttons
18. To export network image, go to File -> Export -> Network to image... and export as PDF once with and once without labels (check "Export text as font" for both)
19. Save style by going to File -> Export -> Styles to file...
