Cytoscape overview network

1. Open Cytoscape (3.8.1)
2. Click "Import Network" button
3. Select tsv file saved by BE19-08_General_Cytoscape.R script
4. Define columns:
	protein = source node
	geneSys = target node
	gene    = target node attribute
	log2fc  = target node attribute
	q       = target node attribute
	interaction  = interaction type
	intcountnode = target node attribute
	intcountedge = edge attribute
	intcountrev  = edge attribute
5. Go to File -> Import -> Styles from file... and select BE19_overview_style.xml
   Now, select this style in Style tab where it is called "BE19_redblu"
	This style contains a diverging red-blu color gradient for "log2fc", which is capped as follows:
		CMYK for -1: 167, 62, 0, 59
		CMYK for +1: 0, 140, 163, 40
	The size of the bubbles corresponds with the number of proteins it affects
6. Remove labels from all nodes except proteins:
	Go to Filter menu and click hamburger icon to create new filter "All except proteins"
	Click the "+" button and choose "Degree Filter"
	Select: "In is between 1 and 297" (make sure slider is at max)
	-> Now all nodes except the proteins should be selected
	Go to the Style menu and click on the "Mapping" button for "Label"
	For column, select "shared name" and for type select "Passthrough Mapping"
	Now click on the "Bypass" button for "Label"
	Just enter a space -> this results in an empty label for all selected nodes
7. For a non-overlapping network, go to Layout -> yFiles Organic Layout
8. For a more compact network, go to Layout -> Edge-weighted Spring Embedded
	 Adjust settings by going to Layout -> Settings... and adjust as follows:
		Edge column that contains weights: intcountrev
		How to interpret weight values: 1-normalized value
		The minimum edge weight to consider: 0
		The maximum edge weight to consider: 11
		The default edge weight to consider: 10
		Average number of iterations for each node: 50
9. Manually adjust nodes, especially proteins to get a nice look (press cmd to drag-select)
10. To export network image, go to File -> Export -> Network to image... and export as PDF once with and once without text (check "Export text as font" for both)
